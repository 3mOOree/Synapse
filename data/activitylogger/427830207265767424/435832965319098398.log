Enable passive mode so you can prevent being killed by a different user.\n2. When you get errors like "Transaction Error, Rockstar has been receiving too many requests from you" just spam enter and confirm all of the errors, they will prevent you from getting money if you do not accept them.\n3. Only AFK with a software that will spam "Enter" for you such as Macrogamer and TinyTask and accept the errors.\n\n**NOT to do.**\n1. Do **Not** spend the money you were dropped in the same session, go to a new session first then spend your money.\n2. Do **Not** run around picking up others money . Stay still or sit and collect the money.\n3. Do **Not** troll people.\n4. Do **Not** kill people who haven't got passive mode. It will get you kicked.\n5.
