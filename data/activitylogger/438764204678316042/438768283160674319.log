2018-04-27 05:12:45 #vent @Fucking-san#2786: Mmmm maybe try talking to them calmly and try to talk about it in a way they feel comfortable?\nCause they shouldn't do something like this because not only are they hurting themselves but you as well, it's never good to stay silent about it and blame yourself.
2018-04-27 05:13:07 #vent @iza#4287: ill try but like... if im being honest it may just have been for the aesthetic

2018-05-01 06:56:51 #vent @Ritewine#7082: Uh they are dating someone else

2018-05-03 02:02:47 #vent @zashi#5107: thank you ‚ù§
2018-05-03 02:22:09 #vent @Midnight#4055: May I ask what you need to talk about? I may be able to help maybe? Only if you're comfortable with that, of course. Otherwise I wish you all the best and hope things go well.
2018-05-03 02:23:50 #vent @zashi#5107: it's. A Lot. but basically he wants to have a relationship with someone that hurt me and i dont think he really cares about me anymore and hes really secretive about his life and i. might need to break up with him cause its hurting me but i want to try to talk to him first,
2018-05-03 02:45:12 #vent @Midnight#4055: That makes sense. And is certainly a sticky situation. You could just play the "We need to talk, *now.*" card. A bit harsh, but effective when you want someone's attention.
2018-05-03 02:45:45 #vent @Midnight#4055: And it you're able to get out what you need to say right there and then, rather than giving the opportunity for small talk.
2018-05-03 02:46:21 #vent @zashi#5107: im thinking about just trying to write out how im feeling and sending it to start to conversation
2018-05-03 02:46:27 #vent @zashi#5107: im just. not sure what to say
2018-05-03 02:47:28 #vent @Midnight#4055: Ahh, yeah. Organizing your thoughts is always the most difficult. Specifically with things like this, in my perspective.
