2018-04-18 21:44:27 #development @「𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐨𝐭𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐨」ᴮᴼᵀ#2600: you either do async or threading
2018-04-18 21:44:28 #development @「𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐨𝐭𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐨」ᴮᴼᵀ#2600: not both
2018-04-18 21:44:37 #development @「𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐨𝐭𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐨」ᴮᴼᵀ#2600: (i think)
2018-04-18 21:44:52 #development @「𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐨𝐭𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐨」ᴮᴼᵀ#2600: and as much as i understand, d.py requires async to function
2018-04-18 21:44:56 #development @「𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐨𝐭𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐨」ᴮᴼᵀ#2600: so, no
2018-04-18 21:45:38 #development @FlamingCore#8440: what if i want to do a daily task :?
2018-04-18 21:45:53 #development @FlamingCore#8440: i cant think of a different way than using a thread

2018-04-18 22:12:23 #development @「𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐨𝐭𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐨」ᴮᴼᵀ#2600: basically
2018-04-18 22:12:41 #development @「𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐨𝐭𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐨」ᴮᴼᵀ#2600: you can even get really specific with the time and date and stuff
2018-04-18 22:12:51 #development @「𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐨𝐭𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐨」ᴮᴼᵀ#2600: like i needed one that runs on the last day of the moneth
2018-04-18 22:13:06 #development @「𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐨𝐭𝐬𝐮𝐛𝐨」ᴮᴼᵀ#2600: so i did ```sched.add_job(scrub_x(500.0),'cron',hour='0',minute='00',day='last')```

2018-04-20 06:56:11 #development @XkijuX#6667: hmm then the problem might be this ```          var removeList = "";\n          var removeId = "";\n          \n          while(users.size > amounts[i])\n          {\n            removeId = users.randomKey()\n            users.delete(removeId); // Remove one random user.\n            // console.log(removeId);\n            removeList = removeList + ";" + removeId;\n            console.log(removeList);\n          }```
2018-04-20 06:56:24 #development @XkijuX#6667: how do i make it change so it takes the values outside the loop
2018-04-20 06:57:43 #development @duncte123#1245: add `console.log(removeList);` after the loop
2018-04-20 06:57:47 #development @duncte123#1245: it should change them
2018-04-20 06:58:14 #development @XkijuX#6667: i did
2018-04-20 06:58:30 #development @XkijuX#6667: ```\n````
2018-04-20 06:58:32 #development @duncte123#1245: you added it inside of the loop
2018-04-20 06:58:34 #development @XkijuX#6667: just empty
2018-04-20 06:58:49 #development @XkijuX#6667: ```            removeId = users.randomKey()\n            users.delete(removeId); // Remove one random user.\n            // console.log(removeId);\n            removeList = removeList + ";" + removeId;\n            console.log(removeList);\n          }\n            await client.channels.get(config.EndChannel).send("**These people reacted with " + classes[i] +":**\n" + reactions[i].users.map(s => '<@' + s.id + '>').join('\n'));\n        };\n        console.log(removeList)```
2018-04-20 06:59:12 #development @duncte123#1245: I need more info from above the loop
2018-04-20 06:59:35 #development @duncte123#1245: where are you getting `ammounts[i]` from for example
2018-04-20 07:00:09 #development @XkijuX#6667: ```      var amounts = eventFile.events[endName].amount;```
2018-04-20 07:00:20 #development @duncte123#1245: and what is `i`?
2018-04-20 07:00:55 #development @XkijuX#6667: ```            "amount": [\n                "2",\n                "1"\n            ],```
2018-04-20 07:01:28 #development @duncte123#1245: can you send the entire function on hastebin?
2018-04-20 07:01:50 #development @duncte123#1245: because I can't do much with the snippets provided
2018-04-20 07:02:04 #development @XkijuX#6667: https://hastebin.com/adunikodex.js
2018-04-20 07:04:23 #development @duncte123#1245: I think that `users.size` is never bigger than `ammounts[i]`
2018-04-20 07:04:49 #development @XkijuX#6667: thats correct
2018-04-20 07:05:09 #development @XkijuX#6667: because there can only be X amount of users and therefore the other get in the leftovers
2018-04-20 07:05:30 #development @duncte123#1245: that means that your while loop is never looping thus your `removeList` is never filled
2018-04-20 07:06:45 #development @XkijuX#6667: its looping and removeList = ``;163372054610051072;310136864898154497;238312447411355648`` in this example
2018-04-20 07:07:17 #development @duncte123#1245: wait
2018-04-20 07:07:48 #development @duncte123#1245: you declared the `removeList` inside of the for loop and you try to access it outside of it
2018-04-20 07:08:27 #development @duncte123#1245: move ```\nvar removeList = "";\nvar removeId = "";```\nunder ```var otherR = "";``` and try it again
2018-04-20 07:08:53 #development @XkijuX#6667: ok

2018-04-28 04:41:03 #development @𝗝𝗼𝘀𝗵𝘂𝗹𝗶𝘂#1897: im still having problems posting my server count in python
2018-04-28 04:41:55 #development @𝗝𝗼𝘀𝗵𝘂𝗹𝗶𝘂#1897: here's my code so far: `requests.post('https://bots.discord.pw/api/bots/424817451293736961/stats', data={"server_count": len(self.bot.guilds)}, headers={"Authorization":"myapitoken",'Content-Type': 'application/json'}) `

2018-04-28 04:49:32 #development @Throudin#4867: There's supposed to be an underscore in `server_count` and are you sure you are including your whole API token?

2018-04-28 05:21:59 #development @𝗝𝗼𝘀𝗵𝘂𝗹𝗶𝘂#1897: and server count does have an underscore in it

2018-04-28 05:56:22 #development @Throudin#4867: I doubt it would make any difference, but what if you swap the order of Content-Type and Authorization headers? (And stay consisted with what question marks are use.)
2018-04-28 05:57:10 #development @Throudin#4867: Other than that, the only thing I can suggest is are you *sure* your full token is being provided.

2018-04-28 06:19:15 #development @Throudin#4867: Bizarre. I'm not sure what else to try. We made sure the token was fresh and copied in full. We tried changing the order of the headers, We tried doing `json=` instead of `data=`. We tried making sure all the quotation marks were the same, either " or '. Have we tried, I don't know if this would help, setting that arguments as variables and then assigning them like.\n\n```python\nurl = "https://bots.discord.pw/api/bots/424817451293736961/stats"\nheader = {"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "thetoken"}\ndata = {"server_count": len(self.bot.guilds)}\nreq = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=header)\n```

2018-04-28 16:26:46 #development @PassTheMayo#1281: SQLite is very light weight
2018-04-28 16:26:49 #development @PassTheMayo#1281: It's great for small bots
2018-04-28 16:27:01 #development @PassTheMayo#1281: but once your bot grows, get a proper external DB like Rethink or MySQL
2018-04-28 16:27:15 #development @PassTheMayo#1281: SQLite isn't good for multi-process bots like d.js v11 sharding

2018-04-28 16:27:49 #development @Void#1488: yeah if I have the need to start sharding I'll probably go over to mysql or mariadb

2018-04-28 17:50:40 #development @LWTech#0005: Rethink is relatively easy to get your head around, especially with the JS driver as it uses the JSON data model with no alterations
2018-04-28 17:50:54 #development @LWTech#0005: MongoDB has schemas and models and a lot of superficial fluff
2018-04-28 17:51:12 #development @LWTech#0005: And there’s the “MongoDB is webscale” meme
