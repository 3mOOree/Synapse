2018-04-20 05:59:26 #information @Googie2149#2149: Hey guys,\nWe're currently looking to bring new Verification Helpers onto the team. If you're interested, send me a DM (Googie2149#2149)\nThis isn't going to be super formal, but please include any information that may be useful in your application\n\nMinimum requirements are:\n- Have/had a bot listed in this server\n- Have been in this server for at least 6 months or otherwise well known\n\nWe currently don't have an exact number of Helpers we're looking to bring on. Deadline is floating as long as I'm still getting applicants within a reasonable minimum time, so apply soon! <a:googieAnim:427370516203175936>

2018-04-22 13:52:52 #information @Googie2149#2149: Applications seem to be slowing down, so you've got until the end of today (midnight Eastern time, about 14 hours from this message) to submit an application if you haven't already. It might be a day or two after that for us to work over the applications, but I'll update everyone that applied in DMs once we have. <a:twirl:427366133356560385>
2018-04-25 05:12:16 #information @Googie2149#2149: Thank you to everyone that applied for the Verification Helper role!\n\nWe had a lot of people apply, and it was a tough choice determining who to bring aboard. While you may not have been chosen, it doesn't mean you're forever counted out of being selected in the future. Though I'm pretty bad at planning things, so I can't say I know when the next time we'll be doing this.\n\nExcept that one guy that had been in the server a week. <a:PlateSpin:437577999936651265>
