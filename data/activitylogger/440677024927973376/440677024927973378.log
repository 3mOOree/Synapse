2018-05-01 01:48:21 #general @FredBoat♪♪#7284: Thanks for using Fredboat Music! To get started, join a voice channel and type `;;play <song name>`. I'll give you a list of 5 songs where you can choose one by typing `;;play <number>`.\n\nType `;;commands` for a list of commands you can use! Or go to <https://fredboat.com/docs> for a full review of what I can do. Type `;;help` for documentation, bot invite links, and an invite to the Fredboat Hangout Discord Server.\n\nYou can set up FredBoat to announce music as it plays and automatically resume when a user enters the channel with the `;;config` command.\n\nI can speak your language, too! Type `;;language` to see a list of languages I can speak. It should look like this: `;;language en_US` but with your language code.\n\nI have a built in permissions system you can use! Follow this link to learn more: <https://fredboat.com/docs/permissions>
