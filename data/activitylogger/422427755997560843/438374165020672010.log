2018-04-25 07:33:11 #tips-and-tricks @Adelia#3721: Step-by-step procedure you need to follow to download the game. Also there is a method for changing the game’s language from Thai to English. Without further ado, let’s get on with it!
2018-04-25 07:33:29 #tips-and-tricks @Adelia#3721: Game Client\n\nFirst thing you’ll need to do is go to https://www.garena.sg and download the Garena client. Once you’ve got that downloaded, go ahead and install it. You’ll need to make an account with them first before you can log in. There is a prompt for this in the client’s login screen.\n\nNow you’re logged in, you’ll want to go to the settings:

2018-04-25 07:34:11 #tips-and-tricks @Adelia#3721: Clicking on the cog icon will open a screen that’ll take you straight to this window:

2018-04-25 07:34:39 #tips-and-tricks @Adelia#3721: You’ll want to change your region to Thailand to get the Ring of Elysium client available to download. Once you’ve changed your region, install RoE and you’re ready to “hack” the game to get it changed into English. Now that the game is installed, navigate to the game’s folder and make sure you scan it with something like Malwarebytes. For some reason, Tencent opted to put a cryptocurrency miner in the form of a Trojan in the game’s folder, the cheeky bastards.
2018-04-25 07:35:07 #tips-and-tricks @Adelia#3721: Converting the Language\n\nIn order to change the language, you’ll need to download a program called “Process Hacker”. A safe download site is: https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/. Once it’s downloaded and installed, go ahead and launch the game from the Garena client. Once the game is active (ready to play), you need to open Process Hacker. Once Process Hacker is opened up, scroll down until you find this:

2018-04-25 07:35:37 #tips-and-tricks @Adelia#3721: You’ll need to copy everything that’s in the “Command line” box. This is the part that basically tells the game which servers to use and what language to use. We’re not going to change anything in there. After copying the command line to the clipboard, right click on your desktop and select “New”, from the menu that pops out, select “Text Document”. Once that’s done, go right ahead and open up the file you just made and paste the command line text into it. You should have something that looks like this:

2018-04-25 07:36:11 #tips-and-tricks @Adelia#3721: Creating the New Launch File\n\nAfter you’ve done the editing, you need to make this Text Document become a batch file. To do this, click on “File”, then go to “Save As…”.\n\nWhen you’re presented with the save interface, you need to make sure that you save the file as “All Files” by choosing it from the drop-down menu below the filename field. Once you’ve done that, you can save the file as “Ring of Elysium.bat”. It is imperative to have “.bat” at the end of the filename, the rest of it doesn’t matter. The “.bat” changes how your computer sees the file. Batch files are mini executables and this will become your new “launch” icon for RoE. Launching it from the Garena client will launch the game in Thai.\n\nNow you’re done and ready to go click heads! Good luck, Have fun
