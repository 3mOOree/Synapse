If you message me in DMs, I'd be happy to chat! I would like to help, but if you could please keep it out of our friendly servers it would be ideal <3*\n7 ; **NO ARGUING WITH ADMINS**\n*Alright, I know at times the admins can be a bit unfair, and in these cases if you respond in dms and with a calm and positive manner we can sort our problems out nicely and well. If you try to argue with admins, we will be forced to take action. If the admins are still being unfair after a dm negotiation, please message me with screenshots of the conversation and I will handle it.*\n8 ; **NO SPAM**\n*Alright, the only excuse to this is if you donâ€™t use your microphone in vc. Otherwise, people get annoyed having to scroll through chats and find out whatâ€™s going on. It doesnâ€™t matter how â€˜cringeyâ€™ you are, youâ€™ll get warnings and then youâ€™ll be kicked afterwards. I donâ€™t care how badly you need attention, spam in my server and youâ€™ll be warned.*\n9 ; **NO MIC SPAM** \n*So, this deserves its own rule, because lots of people make it so that itâ€™s loud and ear rape. It annoys people and i will not tolerate it. First will be just a server mute for 5 minuets, do it again and youâ€™ll get 10 mins server ban and a warning. Any more than that you might be kicked.*

If a moderator hears you say it, perm ban, but if I'm told, you will be kicked for a week until I allow you back in.* **Exceptions May Apply**\n2 ; **NO NSFW ROLEPLAY**\n*People are squeemish when it comes to anything too sexual, but if you'd like to roleplay, you can make a family friendly one in the <#432806718272045056> chat! If it becomes too raunchu, you will be advised to either a) Take it to dms, or b) be warned.* \n3 ; **3 WARNINGS**\n*3 warnings will result in a kick for 24 hours, if you have to be kicked again it will result in a week ban, 3 kicks is a month, if you have to be kicked once more it is perm ban. After you are kicked the first time, you will not have another warning between the next 3 bans. Some rules will have less warnings, staff may change the amount of warnings you get*\n4 ; **NO RACISIM**\n*Alright, this is just a no. Some racist jokes will be tolerated considering they are meant to be jokes, but if people are offended by said joke, Me or another mod will message you and talk to you privately. If the joke is visably explicit or directed at a member of the server, a warning will be given.* \n5 ; **NO STAFF HARRASMENT**\n*This is just wrong, calling admins! if you have a serious question about something or reporting harrasment.  If they are constantly messaged asking for anything other than reporting harrasment or anything disobeying this will cause in a warning and or kick depending on the situation.*

Sometimes youâ€™ll get away with it if itâ€™s a joke, but sometimes itâ€™s just stupid. It gets annoying and rude, and itâ€™s just uncalled for. If i see fake drama to get attention i will not be merciful. Donâ€™t call it unfair, itâ€™s just stupid.*
