2018-05-02 19:41:52 #th-general @Dragoneex#3224: Reisen is good for legacy mode, for point device i recommend playing with reimu
2018-05-02 19:48:02 #th-general @Dragoneex#3224: What difficulty do you prefer of playing guys?

2018-05-02 20:50:20 #th-general @RajangIdiotKun#4660: I thought it was 6
2018-05-02 20:50:52 #th-general @Dragoneex#3224: 6 is hard because you have to beat it on normal mode (easy mode has only 5 stages)
2018-05-02 20:52:26 #th-general @RajangIdiotKun#4660: 6 is hard cuz no visible hitbox
2018-05-02 20:52:46 #th-general @Dragoneex#3224: You can add a hitbox patch
2018-05-02 20:52:53 #th-general @RajangIdiotKun#4660: Thats cheating
2018-05-02 20:53:00 #th-general @Dragoneex#3224: Not really
2018-05-02 20:53:07 #th-general @RajangIdiotKun#4660: Yes really
2018-05-02 20:53:44 #th-general @Dragoneex#3224: I played it long time with visible patch, and it also improve your skills
2018-05-02 20:54:07 #th-general @RajangIdiotKun#4660: Guess I'll cheat then
2018-05-02 21:44:07 #th-general @Attacker#5300: I noticed alot of characters shoot alot or balls
