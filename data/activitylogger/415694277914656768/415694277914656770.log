Can you beat me too?\nThink of any character or person, real or fictional, say `!aki start` to start playing, and I will read your mind!\n\nSay `!aki help` for more information about me and settings, like changing my language or prefix.\n\nHappy thonking! <a:athinkspinrotated:393572084640514050>\n- _Dabinator & Napster#0001_
