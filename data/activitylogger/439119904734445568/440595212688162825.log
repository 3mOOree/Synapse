2018-05-02 16:24:40 #general @ur mom#1471: ISLAM: Is it haram to swear and say the "F word"?\nIs it haram to swear and say the "f word"? Not at anyone. Like pretend you watched a funny video with someone, and then you were like "Dude that is f**king hilarious!", would that be haram? My sisters say it is. And once I said the "F word" like "What the f**k?" and my 5 sisters and mom all started yelling like crazy and stuff. \n\nSo is swearing haram, makrooh or neither? Did it say in the quran that its forbidden to say thing like that? I mean nowadays, its something completely normal to swear. Its in movies, books, games, people say it all the time.
