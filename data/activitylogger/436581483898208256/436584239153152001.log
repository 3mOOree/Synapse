2018-04-24 07:29:21 #recovery @Mr. Robot#0007: __**So what recovery actually is?**__\nIt's name sounds different that what it actually is and there is a reason behind it. Reason comes from the GTA IV era. So even in GTA IV there were modders and they were banned too.. so it was then called recovery which meant *recovering the things (money etc) what you lost when you were banned*. But now it means different, things change. Now recovery everywhere means the users *giving their account to modders* so that they can mod their account. Back then it was possible to give money remotely without getting into the account, but since rockstar has patched several things it has changed a lot. Also back then you could get 40k drops if you remember and there were no transaction errors, but now it has turned down to just 2.5k where in you need to spam enter to get rid of the error screen. I know its annoying..\nRecovery is the only way now in GTA V where in modders can give the users tons of money like 1 Billion and RP (best of all). And its a way where in you need to trust the modder in order to get that.!!
2018-04-24 07:29:35 #recovery @Mr. Robot#0007: __**How do I get trust in a modder? I don't know him**__\nIts actually really difficult to trust a stranger just like that, especially when your the first one in your friends circle getting the recovery, or you are just a broke guy that cannot afford scams (actually no one can bear scams. Scams really hurt your feeling even if you are rich enough). When your friend suggests you someone its easy to trust that modder. So pretty much every modder is prepaid because then the modder can be back scammed. Now coming to how to gain trust in someone... first things first, If the modder has a vouches or something channel then he surely isn't a scammer.. secondly, in ever server there must be some a role for ppl who took recovery from the modder, *best* thing you can do is to talk to them and ask them stuff about the modder or his honesty or just some basic questions like how is it done and how fast is it.\n\n__**How much money is safe?**__\nPeople say that money drops are safer!! That's just kinda superstition. If you are putting money in any way be it money drops or recovery, it is equally unsafe. Any amount of money is safe, provided how you use it in session. If you spend a lot of money in the same session where in u got the money drop then you surely are increasing ur chance of getting banned. As for recovery, I'd say there is a limit for that too, I dont exactly remember but it is close to 24 million or something
