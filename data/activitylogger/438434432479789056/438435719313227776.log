2018-04-27 01:54:23 #oc-creation @KingOfWakanda#3659: No healing factor
2018-04-27 01:54:31 #oc-creation @KingOfWakanda#3659: You're already a tough nut to crack
2018-04-27 01:56:10 #oc-creation @ᴄᴏꜱᴍɪᴄ×#4128: It says Asgardians have Energy Manipulation, being a Royal Asgardian I most likely have some form of it.
2018-04-27 01:57:51 #oc-creation @ᴄᴏꜱᴍɪᴄ×#4128: The healing factor is because, it says it is possible for the Asgardian Gods to sustain any form of Injury
2018-04-27 01:58:12 #oc-creation @ᴄᴏꜱᴍɪᴄ×#4128: Regenerative Healing Factor Despite their natural durability, it is possible for any of the Asgardian gods to sustain injury. However, if injured, their highly advanced metabolism enables them to recover with superhuman speed and efficiency. As with most of their other powers, the speed and extent of these powers varies from one Asgardian god to another and is greater for more powerful Asgardians. According Doom during an Asgardian vivisection, a normal Asgardian can heal from having their heart removed for five minutes after the removal in addition to having its neural system continue to function normally

2018-05-01 10:54:17 #oc-creation @『Enderzilla6』#4982: The character's whole way of acting and his point of view of the world **depends** on the backstory
