(robot/klaus)**\n\n1) The recipient should have a completely filled garage.\n\n2) The recipient shouldn’t have any personal vehicle on the street.\n\n3) Choose any player from the list, click on “Gift Vehicle” function, choose any car and spawn it.\n\n4) The recipient should drive this car into the filled garage with a confirmation of the replacement.\n\n5.1. If the car is for resale: the recipient goes to LSC and sells it.\n\n5.2. If you are going to save this car in the garage forever:\n\n5.2.1. the recipient should reconnect to the session/restart the game;\n\n5.2.2. the recipient should go to LSC and buy the full coverage (insurance).\n\nYou can gift and sell only those cars which could be saved in a garage in a honest way.\n\nNotification: The best car for reselling is Elegy Retro Custom in full tuning (Sport> ELEGY).
