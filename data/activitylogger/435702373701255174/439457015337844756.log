Only AFK with a software that will spam "Enter" for you such as Macrogamer and TinyTask and accept the errors.\n\n**NOT to do.**\n1. Do **Not** spend the money you were dropped in the same session, go to a new session first then spend your money.\n2. Do **Not** run around picking up others money . Stay still or sit and collect the money.\n3. Do **Not** troll people.\n4. Do **Not** kill people who haven't got passive mode. It will get you kicked.\n5.
