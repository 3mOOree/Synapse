2018-04-24 11:09:09 #diary @★Turkey★#1994: Here’s the one for yesterday:
2018-04-24 11:25:51 #diary @★Turkey★#1994: Today I had a really fun and comfortable day. Basically just went shopping and got my haircut that I absolutely adore. As you guys may know from the first day, I’m FTM(Female to Male). This has started my transformation and I shall keep you guys updated on everything. I will be starting hormones in a few weeks meaning that my voice will be deeper. Thank you guys for being so supportive throughout this all. P.S. I’m going by He/Him now~ Love you guys. ❤️
2018-04-24 11:29:24 #diary @★Turkey★#1994: Oh and I’m completely supporting this side of me now. ❤️
2018-04-26 11:02:08 #diary @★Turkey★#1994: Again, I’m sorry that I haven’t posted one in a while.
2018-04-26 11:02:17 #diary @★Turkey★#1994: I’ll explain what happened.
2018-04-26 11:09:16 #diary @★Turkey★#1994: Yesterday I mostly just slept because y’know, I’m sick like usual. In the afternoon I did boring stuff because of the boring person I am. Something interesting did happen last night though. So, last night I went to close the backdoor and ended up slamming my finger in the door. I went to the hospital and I was told that I fractured my finger. We did around 30 X-rays and then they put me in a temporary cast until I go to the doctors to get the actual cast. I got home around 3 am and fell asleep for two hours. Still going to try to get everything done today. It’s quite hard for me to type so I might type less.
2018-04-26 11:12:13 #diary @★Turkey★#1994: Overall great day, 10/10. I’ll actually try my hardest to remember to post at the end of the day today.
2018-04-26 11:13:00 #diary @★Turkey★#1994: Oh and if you were wondering, I try to plan everything around the times of 7:40-3:00.
2018-04-27 01:08:48 #diary @★Turkey★#1994: Actually doing one for once. This one will be a little shorter than the others by the way. So all of the day I pretty much just did paperwork and worked because I had to get caught up. Something this afternoon happened, quite recent. Someone told me to send nudes and was harassing me. So now I’m insanely stressing out due to that because I have to get everything ready to do a report. Nothing ever happened like this to me before so I’m a little scared. ANYWAYS, tomorrow I’ll be going to a cupcake food truck which’ll be fun! Love you guys, have a lovely day/night/sleep/morning~ ❤️
2018-04-28 01:33:58 #diary @★Turkey★#1994: Hello everyone! I've had an amazing day even though I was doing a shit ton of work this morning. Today I went to a cupcake food truck which is fun.
