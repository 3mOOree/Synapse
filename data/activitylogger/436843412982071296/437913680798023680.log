2018-04-23 09:57:02 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Thank you Gutter for making this channel, and thank you Turkey for trusting me and inviting me to this server. It's no secret that most, if not all members here know each other from KindVoice. KindVoice is a big server with a lot going on and I never get the opportunity to talk to any of you on neutral grounds, in a casual setting like this. I am grateful to get this opportunity! What I meant this channel to be for is to give you, the members of KindVoice, a place to tell me how you feel about the server, in a no-judgement environment.
2018-04-23 09:57:54 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: So please tell me how you feel, how we run it, what makes kindvoice great or awful, and what you would like to see differently.

2018-04-23 10:06:12 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: I be honest. It's a really good server, though a lot of drama. General-chat is always filled with trolls and or people trolling and so I think that that may new to be resolved.

General-chat is always filled with trolls and or people trolling and so I think that that may new to be resolved. I also feel a lot of people have began to judge people by their role which I don't feel is right.
2018-04-23 10:07:40 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Yeah, I completely agree. Do you have any ideas how we can resolve these issues?
2018-04-23 10:08:22 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Ive said this in my mod application. A simple timer for when people join.
2018-04-23 10:08:57 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Make them unable to message for 10 minutes upon joining, or set it so that they would need to ping a mod for access.
2018-04-23 10:09:22 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: I think it would help against the trolls that spam accounts.
2018-04-23 10:09:33 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Would make it a lot less enjoyable for them
2018-04-23 10:10:26 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Those are good points.
2018-04-23 10:10:53 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: What I afraid about that kind of system of baring someone a few minutes from messaging is that we might delay help from people that really need asap support.
2018-04-23 10:12:01 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Gutter, that's exactly the reason why we chose to not have that timer.
2018-04-23 10:12:13 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: But I am open for new ideas.
2018-04-23 10:12:31 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Well couldnt they just talk in a channel only accesible for new members?
2018-04-23 10:12:41 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: If they really need help they could tell that in there
2018-04-23 10:12:44 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: That's a good idea Glenn.
2018-04-23 10:12:46 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: And maybe let supports in there too
2018-04-23 10:12:55 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: In that particular channel.
2018-04-23 10:13:09 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: And I feel like we could set a mod to look over newer members to make sure there aren't any sign of trolls. And if there is then I feel like we could take that into the Staff server and talk about everyone who is suspicious to be trolling. Though it would most likely have to be an active mod which wouldn't leave much time for other mod duties.

2018-04-23 10:13:33 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Hmm
2018-04-23 10:13:49 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: With people whom are trolling they usually show early signs of being a troll.
2018-04-23 10:13:52 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: May I suggest, doing .userinfo for every new member that joins?
2018-04-23 10:14:09 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: So you can instantly see when their account has been created.
2018-04-23 10:14:26 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Usually if its created on the day itself, its a troll.
2018-04-23 10:14:33 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: **Usually**
2018-04-23 10:15:31 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: USUALLY. Most people troll for the hell of it so they make sure they have atleast a few days on their account before beginning to troll. They do that so they can't be identified that way.
2018-04-23 10:15:38 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: We actually have a channel that shows us this (attachment url(s): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/437913680798023680/437919470468595713/unknown.png)
2018-04-23 10:16:10 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: We have about a couple joins and leaves per hour
2018-04-23 10:16:14 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: So it's mostly just a lot of work
2018-04-23 10:16:29 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: ^
2018-04-23 10:16:44 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: But we do always keep track of the channel
2018-04-23 10:17:13 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: We've talked about that in roundtable on the KVStaff channel. Simply too much work to look at every single person.
2018-04-23 10:18:51 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: What if we assign a dedicated person to it?
2018-04-23 10:19:09 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: I mean sure you'd have to rely on just 1 but..
2018-04-23 10:19:54 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: We do have people looking at it and we keep track of the people who are possible "alts"
2018-04-23 10:20:13 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: what we call possible alts are accounts that join minutes after creation
2018-04-23 10:20:32 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: Mods are people too that can't really monitor everyone O_O but I like Glenn's idea of new member's only accessible channel, but I can see the problem of someone that wishes to seek help on say, general-chat (I know gen chat should be light hearted.. but in a case of an emergency where someone really needs attention and being noticed is enough to help them can keep them alive and bring the attention of other members to support them)
2018-04-23 10:20:34 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Like Vaults
2018-04-23 10:21:00 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: We have a member discussion channel where we write this kind of things down.
2018-04-23 10:21:18 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Like gutter#0001 is possible alt of Glenn#0001
2018-04-23 10:21:23 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: And that's it
2018-04-23 10:21:24 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Mhm
2018-04-23 10:21:29 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Or
2018-04-23 10:21:50 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Hoji#0001 joined a second after Hoji#0002, possible trolls
2018-04-23 10:22:03 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Stuff like that
2018-04-23 10:22:06 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Also a good example
2018-04-23 10:22:59 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I just want to thank you all for letting me know how you feel.
2018-04-23 10:23:11 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I hope you understand I am not just declining everything you say
2018-04-23 10:23:29 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: As long it is human monitoring the system, there will always be slips, but the most dangerous ones.. are the ones that stayed long enough to create deep damages not just on the server but on members too
2018-04-23 10:23:29 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: I know, no worries.
2018-04-23 10:23:46 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Ive brought it up to Chou about 1 member of the mod team that I don't trust.
2018-04-23 10:24:08 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: I'm sure you know who I am talking about.
2018-04-23 10:24:14 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Yeah, don’t worry about it. I understand everything is always discussed.
2018-04-23 10:24:22 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: And Glenn, yep. I do.
2018-04-23 10:24:38 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Its just that Chou asked me about the situation and I helped.
2018-04-23 10:24:58 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: You can be honest, I won't leak information from here.
2018-04-23 10:25:02 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I need to know how you feel.
2018-04-23 10:25:03 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Ah, alright, I see.
2018-04-23 10:25:30 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: ~~Glenn, I can tell him if you’d like~~
2018-04-23 10:25:37 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: When I get home I will send the screenshots
2018-04-23 10:25:40 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Oh you can too
2018-04-23 10:25:49 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: I just can't at the moment because of work
2018-04-23 10:26:00 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Ah, I see.
2018-04-23 10:26:14 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Let me quickly go and get the screenshots.
2018-04-23 10:26:34 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I think I know who this is about, I think you called it "setting people up to each other"
2018-04-23 10:26:40 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: That situation?
2018-04-23 10:26:47 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Correct.
2018-04-23 10:26:51 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Okay,  say no more.
2018-04-23 10:27:41 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: I’ll send in a few screenshots in me and Glenn’s DM’s.
2018-04-23 10:27:47 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: It's actually a case that is being discussed internally right now, but I can't say too much about it.

2018-04-23 10:28:01 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: And then I’ll move on to the DM’s with the person.
2018-04-23 10:28:04 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Ah I think Chou already provided  @★Turkey★
2018-04-23 10:28:20 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I think Chou shared the screenshots in the HR channel.
2018-04-23 10:28:27 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Mhm
2018-04-23 10:28:38 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: *Let me just share my person screenshots with him then.*
2018-04-23 10:28:48 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: As in from DM’s.
2018-04-23 10:28:54 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Yeah alright.
2018-04-23 10:28:57 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: You three need a seperate DM group for this, other members should'nt be pulled into this just because they are able to read these
2018-04-23 10:29:08 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Yeah i think so too.
2018-04-23 10:29:16 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Thanks Gutter.
2018-04-23 10:29:28 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: This is quite personal and no longer about KV as a whole.
2018-04-23 10:29:37 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: KV has been ruined for several people already that knows the inner working.. or realised the drama from KV, I still want KV to be a safe place for people
2018-04-23 10:29:46 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: mhm
2018-04-23 10:30:18 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Yeah
2018-04-23 10:30:21 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: There is a lot more going on behind the scenes than meets the eye.
2018-04-23 10:30:29 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: I came to know a bit more than I wanted to know sadly

2018-04-23 10:31:24 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Can you maybe delete that screenshot? We can discuss that case in DMs

2018-04-23 10:33:47 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Thank you, and good luck with the discussion.
2018-04-23 10:33:52 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: In a few minutes though, busy at the moment. Have fun Glenn!
2018-04-23 10:36:12 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: Just a few hours ago, a user (whom I will not name) got really anxious that they lost their safe place that is KV where their friend could be mistreated and one day it could be them who get mistreated. The person is quite emotionally stable and I was surprised they seek support from me a (never requested support even after a few months after joining KV) just because of this issue.
2018-04-23 10:37:18 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Is this about what happened last night?
2018-04-23 10:37:30 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: A couple users got banned.
2018-04-23 10:37:47 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: I would like to imagine that yes, every institution has it's kinks in it's inner working, but that doesn't mean on the outside it cannot be a safe heaven to people that need it. So keep the backgrounf workings in the backgroud, so to say. No more exposing drama to the public.
2018-04-23 10:37:54 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: mhm, yes Vivid
2018-04-23 10:38:33 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: That's a good point, thanks Gutter.
2018-04-23 10:40:11 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: Even a few months ago some people I know has lost their faith in KV because of trolls that ran rampant when the voice access used to be granted immediately, but then the problem has been fixed which is great!
2018-04-23 10:41:36 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Sorry about that. Stepped out because I didn’t know about this situation.

2018-04-23 10:44:06 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Due to details I could see that it was a pretty serious event that occurred so I didn’t want to mess nothing up since I didn’t have a lot of base information.
2018-04-23 10:46:09 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: There was a user who started a raid, the user and raiders got banned, but the user was liked all around, so people wanted to defend him and bargain to get him back, and that led to a couple more bans.
2018-04-23 10:46:28 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: It was quite a dumpster fire.
2018-04-23 10:46:43 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Oh, and that was last night? Not in the morning or anything?
2018-04-23 10:47:00 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I think that depends on your timezone.
2018-04-23 10:47:21 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Well, what time was it for you?
2018-04-23 10:47:40 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: 5:00 AM
2018-04-23 10:47:48 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: 11 PM for me.
2018-04-23 10:48:41 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: Jordyn you werent there. It happened around your afternoon after your left KV
2018-04-23 10:48:57 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: I left in the morning around 10 am.
2018-04-23 10:49:23 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Maybe I don't know the exact time because I was asleep.
2018-04-23 10:49:26 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I wasn't there either.
2018-04-23 10:49:26 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: So no, I was not there.

2018-04-23 10:49:36 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: However
2018-04-23 10:49:56 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: A lot of members let us know that they're unsatisfied with how KV is run.
2018-04-23 10:50:11 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: That's why I wanted to start this roundtable.
2018-04-23 10:50:41 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: There’s just a few minor flaws that can be fixed pretty easily.
2018-04-23 10:52:50 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Thank you all for your honesty.
2018-04-23 10:52:58 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: But Vivid, I have a question.
2018-04-23 10:53:01 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Yeah?
2018-04-23 10:54:18 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Is there any way that we could make it more clear to people that support isn’t always available and things along those lines?
2018-04-23 10:54:37 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Yes that's a very important point, we have to work on that.
2018-04-23 10:54:43 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Ill involve myself if topics I can speak on arrive. Hope you guys can work something out in a positive manner.
2018-04-23 10:54:51 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I'll let them know.
2018-04-23 10:55:02 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I'm sure Hoji, we're all friends here, right?
2018-04-23 10:55:38 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Also yeah I think theres also more support needed. How many people have support role?
2018-04-23 10:56:11 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Not many, but helpers can do support too.
2018-04-23 10:56:19 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Support is just staff.
2018-04-23 10:56:22 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: And helpers aren't.
2018-04-23 10:56:31 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Hmmmm true
2018-04-23 10:56:41 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Yep.
2018-04-23 10:57:36 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: We don’t have too much support, though we have more helpers than support and helpers have the same practical meaning.
2018-04-23 10:57:51 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Im just saying. The server is getting bigger and bigger. So the staff/helpers need to grow with it I guess. Unless youre already at the level you can handle it.
2018-04-23 10:58:04 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: We’re there for if someone either doesn’t mind to talk to either or they prefer to talk to Support and not just a helper.
2018-04-23 10:58:44 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: @★Turkey★ you s aid there are a couple flaws, could you make a bullet point list with these issues, so that we can go more in depth after?
2018-04-23 10:58:55 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: Even as a non support sometimes I am doing some supports O.o and that is already too overwhelming. I think it is really really hard to have more people apply and *remain* as supports, unless, we have some sort of incentive.. o.o it is a bad idea from me but maybe someone can expand on the idea
2018-04-23 10:59:11 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: There doesnt need to be that big of a line between support and helper. Either one of them could resolve an issue or talk with someone in need to help them out

2018-04-23 10:59:46 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: So bridging the gap between support and helpers.
2018-04-23 11:01:01 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Vivid, I think I’m ready to be back in KV.
2018-04-23 11:01:04 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: What I understand is that supports are people that really can give proper supports right? Helpers may not be as efficient as support
2018-04-23 11:01:29 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Completely off topic, but I think I am. Correct, Gutter.
2018-04-23 11:02:05 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: Jordyn? <:hug:437779767920558111> I will support any decision you make 💟
2018-04-23 11:02:55 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Heh-heh, new role needs to be added then.
2018-04-23 11:04:49 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Helpers are respected the same and they can give good support too, but we have to be conservative with who we allow on the staff server, so if someone is particularly professional they can apply for support, who we do expect more from.
2018-04-23 11:05:21 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Turkey do you want an invite?
2018-04-23 11:05:32 #kv-roundtable @★Turkey★#1994: Yes please.
2018-04-23 11:08:09 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I sent you invites.
2018-04-23 11:13:12 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Is it okay if I do an `@​everyone` here? I do want the opinion of all members.
2018-04-23 11:13:40 #kv-roundtable @Quang#3486: Also reset the kv discord invite
2018-04-23 11:13:45 #kv-roundtable @Quang#3486: It like expired
2018-04-23 11:14:15 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Which link do you mean?
2018-04-23 11:14:42 #kv-roundtable @Quang#3486: Oh the one that actually said kindvoice
2018-04-23 11:15:21 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: We lost partnership so that link doesn't exist anymore.
2018-04-23 11:16:33 #kv-roundtable @Quang#3486: Ah
2018-04-23 11:22:10 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Damn.
2018-04-23 11:25:10 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I used to moderate for /r/kindvoice and I started the discord for them too, but the discord was crazy amount of work, well we got partnership and everything, but the result was that everyone was hanging around on the discord instead of on the subreddit, so I was accused of community theft, and we decided to part ways. Good news is that the discord is now completely mine, bad news is that we lost partnership because of it.
2018-04-23 11:27:10 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Sounds unfair.
2018-04-23 11:27:15 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: But glad you got the Discord
2018-04-23 12:11:36 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: hi vivid i can set `@kv friends`
2018-04-23 12:11:55 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: that would be nice4

2018-04-23 12:12:43 #kv-roundtable @NessaTheNerd#2947: You all have great points, and I do believe that KV is improving as a whole
2018-04-23 12:13:11 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: Vivid you can do the `@friends from kv` on the post i pinned
2018-04-23 12:13:42 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: If you edit a mention in it will not mention them.
2018-04-23 12:13:56 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: dem
2018-04-23 12:14:06 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I'll just be patient.
2018-04-23 12:14:53 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: or you can do an announcement like message now and to let everyone know about this and remind them to read the pinned message?

2018-04-23 12:16:03 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: @Friends from KV sorry for the ping, we pinned a message to this channel to explain what this channel is for, it would be very cool if you could read it! Thanks in advance!
2018-04-23 12:16:13 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Like that?

2018-04-23 12:17:06 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: You could set a timer. Then also add a note. That if you really need support as soon as you join. That you ask a mod or HR or an admin. And they can manually remove the timer if they feel the person isn't trolling.
2018-04-23 12:17:20 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Its extra work tho
2018-04-23 12:17:31 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: A note?
2018-04-23 12:17:41 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: As in a automated message?
2018-04-23 12:17:47 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Maybe Pinned
2018-04-23 12:17:55 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Yeah the message you get in the welcome channel
2018-04-23 12:18:01 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Could do.
2018-04-23 12:18:05 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: but people in emotional needs can be very volatile and often time no one bothers to read the note anyways
2018-04-23 12:18:32 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Its an automated message
2018-04-23 12:18:34 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Maybe find a way to tag the new person in it idk
2018-04-23 12:18:37 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: if i am in a fragile state of mind and that i need to go through talking to mods i will be ;-; and give up
2018-04-23 12:18:40 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: They will read it
2018-04-23 12:18:57 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: I mean.
2018-04-23 12:19:12 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Its the first thing they see
2018-04-23 12:19:48 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: They will scroll away o.o like what i see so often on gen chat, or yo umean the pop up thing you get when you join immediately?

2018-04-23 12:20:57 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: There is no 100% fullproof way of getting rid of trolls. You can only filter them.\nAnd sadly trolls will get attracted to places like KV because its full of volatile people who are in trouble.\nSo I don't think trolls will ever stop joining.\nSo there needs to be a better way to filtet them if we are having problems with it right?
2018-04-23 12:21:05 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Also Im just throwing out ideas
2018-04-23 12:21:22 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Not a bad one

2018-04-23 12:26:20 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: in the battle of removing trolls o3o the emotional volatile ones can be seen as trolls at first and I want to say that mods are just people that cannot make the best decision 100% of the time. Trolls are a nuisance yes, but I would hate it if the system implemented for filtering out trolls gives uncesasry hincrance to new users too. i don't want to seem like i am hating on your idea Hoji, I just want to think on the opposite end of the spectrum so that we got all grounds covered <:hug:437779767920558111>
2018-04-23 12:27:10 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Yeah right gutter. Just hate on everything I say

2018-04-23 12:27:36 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: About mods though.
2018-04-23 12:27:56 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: I feel that there are only a few that actively keep gen-chat safe.
2018-04-23 12:28:13 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Mostly when there is a problem, I only ever see Tomb.
2018-04-23 12:28:41 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Btw you're right about mods not being able to make 100% good moves all yhr time.\nBut they are the ones who have the last say in most problems right?
2018-04-23 12:29:06 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Last say isn't best say though.
2018-04-23 12:29:31 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Das not what im implying
2018-04-23 12:30:16 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Just saying.
2018-04-23 12:30:26 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Im just saying regardless if they are correct or not its their call. So if there is any system achievable that can help them make the correct call. We should pursue that
2018-04-23 12:30:38 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Mhm
2018-04-23 12:30:56 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Mixed feelings on that regarding my current situation.
2018-04-23 12:31:08 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Sorry :(
2018-04-23 12:31:12 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: No need.
2018-04-23 12:31:21 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: None of your concern silly.
2018-04-23 12:31:36 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: It just makes me see some in another light.
2018-04-23 12:34:26 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Just so you know, all issues that we see are discussed before we take action. No one mod has the right to ban / kick / mute without discussing it first.
2018-04-23 12:34:26 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Also I feel like it would be valuable to hear about a mod's opinion on these things
2018-04-23 12:35:07 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: We want to keep all mod actions fair and without bias.
2018-04-23 12:35:13 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: I don't want it to feel like Im taking shots at soneone who can't defend himself T_T lol
2018-04-23 12:36:02 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I understand, but the point of this roundtable is that you can express your concerns without getting reprimanded.
2018-04-23 12:36:16 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: I do have a concern. u~u
2018-04-23 12:36:24 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Please do tell.
2018-04-23 12:37:18 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: Alright, I wanna preface this by saying, KindVoice is like, probably the best community I've ever seen, in terms of mod behavior.
2018-04-23 12:37:42 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: That's a nice compliment, thank you.
2018-04-23 12:37:44 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: So many other places, the mods just _do not care._ People are judged swiftly, harshly, "Guilty" says Judge Dredd. "20 years." x.x
2018-04-23 12:37:59 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: But KV is not like that, and I love that about them.
2018-04-23 12:38:02 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: That said
2018-04-23 12:38:28 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: I might actually say they swing too far on the other side of the problem: troublemakers kind of run amok for longer then they might. u~u
2018-04-23 12:39:15 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: I think a good rule of thumb is, if the mods tell someone to stop doing something, and they don't stop and/or they say something about how the mods are facists, that might be a time to mute them and talk to them in private.
2018-04-23 12:40:41 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: That is the rule, yes.
2018-04-23 12:40:58 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: Is that the rule? It seems like people are being given more chances then that.
2018-04-23 12:42:03 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: Like, [person says heavy stuff] ...orionclear, person keeps going, !mod, mod tells them to stop, they say "Oh, typical facist mod behavior"
2018-04-23 12:42:09 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: at this point, mod should probably mute them
2018-04-23 12:42:15 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: but often, they give another warning. u~u
2018-04-23 12:42:18 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Well maybe we have been too lenient with that rule, but in theory it should always happen.
2018-04-23 12:43:24 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: The leniency comes from mods being human and not bots. If they are having a really good day they might feel more inclined to give someone another chance  I think
2018-04-23 12:43:55 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Its the only thing I can think of anyways
2018-04-23 12:44:44 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: I mean if I didn't get the chances I did I would have probably been banned already. Yet Im discussing the future of KV here with the owner and a group of friends
2018-04-23 12:44:58 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: So I for one can appreciete leniency at times.
2018-04-23 12:45:19 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: I can too.
2018-04-23 12:45:19 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Just a zero troll policy is right yeah
2018-04-23 12:46:08 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: It is a minor concern, really. But I preferred to say something, rather then stay silent. u~u
2018-04-23 12:46:17 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: It's good, thank you.
2018-04-23 12:46:17 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Like I mean i dont spam.harrassing shit in genchat etc. That's an auto mute for.me yeah
2018-04-23 12:46:38 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: I am very glad to have something like a round table space as well.
2018-04-23 12:46:40 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: It's good feedback.
2018-04-23 12:46:46 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: You are a very good leader, Vivid. ❤
2018-04-23 12:46:52 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Thank you!
2018-04-23 12:47:01 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Thanks for giving us this opportunity thooo
2018-04-23 12:50:40 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: My biggest concern with having a zero tolerance policy is that we'll also ban people who don't really know how it works on kv
2018-04-23 12:51:06 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Because alcohol and swearing is moderated, which is rather strict outside kv
2018-04-23 12:51:14 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: so people also just might be making mistakes
2018-04-23 12:51:56 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Some of you have been no stranger to making jokes about alcohol or weed
2018-04-23 12:52:50 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: And if we would have been stricter about that, muting you for those jokes, then we would've scared away the members who are now the most important
2018-04-23 12:53:44 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: ^^^^^^
2018-04-23 12:55:49 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: Emotionally unstable people sometimes just irrational  or that they are confused about certain things that can or cannot be said, or some might not be socially adapt at reading certain situations ;-; I feel for these kind of people because many will just brush them off and be hostile to them
2018-04-23 12:55:59 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Hmmm thats why I said im glad for the leniency sometimes
2018-04-23 12:56:50 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: However, muting emotionally unstable or irrational behavior can then maybe protect them from getting banned.
2018-04-23 12:57:00 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: So it's a double edged sword.
2018-04-23 12:57:27 #kv-roundtable @LORELEI#8615: mhm
2018-04-23 12:57:28 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I mean if they're muted we can still talk to them in DM and give them some emotional help.
2018-04-23 12:58:00 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: Buy I dont see the occasional weed or alcohol joke as trolling. It might affect someone who is addicted or so but. I define hard trolling as going on the server with the specific goal of hurting people who are just looking for a little help ot positivity in their life. Thats where the zero tolerance policy comes in I would say
2018-04-23 12:58:18 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: You're absolutely right.
2018-04-23 12:58:41 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I do see a difference between a NSFW joke and trolling, of course.
2018-04-23 12:58:51 #kv-roundtable @princess#2600: ~~I’d like to ask a question~~
2018-04-23 12:58:57 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Go ahead princess.
2018-04-23 12:59:03 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: I know Im just aaying I do too  xD
2018-04-23 12:59:06 #kv-roundtable @Hoji808#6597: ❤
2018-04-23 12:59:09 #kv-roundtable @princess#2600: How long does a muting last
2018-04-23 12:59:15 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: 24 hour.
2018-04-23 12:59:24 #kv-roundtable @princess#2600: is that different per person
2018-04-23 12:59:45 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I'm open for suggestions, but right now it isn't.
2018-04-23 13:00:51 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I want to thank you all for your honesty, it is very helpful.

2018-04-23 13:32:47 #kv-roundtable @no dms would be nice (i'm okay)#0349: i'm currently taking a break from discord for personal reasons but i just wanted to say, kindvoice is the best server i ever was in
2018-04-23 13:35:19 #kv-roundtable @no dms would be nice (i'm okay)#0349: i joined kindvoice with this account, which was an alt at first. i created this account specifically to join kindvoice, as i was trying not to be recognized by a person who i knew might join sooner or later
2018-04-23 13:35:59 #kv-roundtable @no dms would be nice (i'm okay)#0349: so i joined kv like 2 minutes after i created this acc
2018-04-23 13:36:25 #kv-roundtable @no dms would be nice (i'm okay)#0349: and joining kv was a great decision
2018-04-23 13:41:12 #kv-roundtable @no dms would be nice (i'm okay)#0349: i dont think i have any issues with the server, trolls happen, but they happen everywhere. i really like the mod team and the rules. i like being taken seriously when i have an issue
2018-04-23 13:41:55 #kv-roundtable @no dms would be nice (i'm okay)#0349: hmmmm ima go back to sleep ill go on later
2018-04-23 13:42:00 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: Followup from earlier: I did say acting like Judge Dredd and condemning people on sight is a _bad_ thing. Zero tolerance is not what I'm advocating. u~u
2018-04-23 13:42:01 #kv-roundtable @princess#2600: nini
2018-04-23 13:42:34 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: It's just, sometimes it's obvious when someone isn't gonna listen. Some people just want to raise a big stink.
2018-04-23 13:42:47 #kv-roundtable @no dms would be nice (i'm okay)#0349: <:upvote:437788226179301377>
2018-04-23 13:43:05 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: Generally you can spot them if you say "Hey cut it out" and the response is "Oh I see, trying to restrict free speech? Is that how it is?"
2018-04-23 13:43:19 #kv-roundtable @Ammie#8153: If they say that, it's best to take the conversation elsewhere. u~u
2018-04-23 13:43:45 #kv-roundtable @no dms would be nice (i'm okay)#0349: i agree
2018-04-23 14:16:13 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Those are good points Ammie.
2018-04-23 14:16:35 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: And thank you for the nice words Lem
2018-04-23 14:25:38 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Yeah..
2018-04-23 14:31:15 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: KV has been the best server I've been on too.
2018-04-23 14:31:31 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Apart from like, a friends server but that is just because my best friends are on there that I've known for 7 years.
2018-04-23 14:31:46 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Of course, that's reasonable.
2018-04-23 14:31:55 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: But it is really well structured, well balanced, and just a great place to be in.
2018-04-23 14:32:05 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Which is one of the reasons why I want to help and make it a better place.
2018-04-23 14:32:14 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: To give others that enjoyment that I've experienced.
2018-04-23 14:32:37 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: I know man. I hope soon we can go back to get you involved.
2018-04-23 14:36:21 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: I will probably be back on the server in a day or two.
2018-04-23 14:36:27 #kv-roundtable @Glenn#2978: Just really needed this time off from all the negativity.
2018-04-23 14:40:57 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: You made a good decision.
2018-04-23 15:12:50 #kv-roundtable @PermSenpie#2043: I'm on a different type of server on my alt. They have it set so that you have to add a certain role to yourself before you can access the rest of the server. You'll have access to rules, welcome, and your newbie channel
2018-04-23 15:13:04 #kv-roundtable @PermSenpie#2043: I wish I could go into this more and show screenshots but
2018-04-23 15:13:16 #kv-roundtable @PermSenpie#2043: *It's not a KV friendly server*
2018-04-23 15:14:48 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Yeah that's what we're discussing at KV too, do we want "gatekeepers" so to say.
2018-04-23 15:16:33 #kv-roundtable @PermSenpie#2043: Mhmm.
2018-04-23 16:34:51 #kv-roundtable @PermSenpie#2043: Or if it has that, ask them to edit it
2018-04-23 16:35:06 #kv-roundtable @PermSenpie#2043: It would also keep people replying to those posts to spam the channel
2018-04-23 16:35:32 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Good point.
2018-04-23 16:36:17 #kv-roundtable @PermSenpie#2043: The problem here is that the mods would have a bit more work
2018-04-23 16:37:21 #kv-roundtable @Tony#9692: @Vivid which ping was I meant to see?
2018-04-23 16:38:33 #kv-roundtable @Emrakull#9001: I feel like we could use more mods, after what happen a day or 2 ago. There were only 2 visible mods online during that raid, and it took 5 mins for a mod to respond to the pings
2018-04-23 16:39:23 #kv-roundtable @PermSenpie#2043: When did that raid happen? I don't think I was around then
2018-04-23 16:43:17 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: We are indeed looking for more mods.
2018-04-23 16:44:40 #kv-roundtable @PermSenpie#2043: Maybe a few more mods in different Timezones. In my afternoons I only see Tomb around, maybe Alfy
2018-04-23 16:48:00 #kv-roundtable @NessaTheNerd#2947: ~~too young to apply, my app would be turned down in a millisecond~~
2018-04-23 16:50:53 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Yeah we would love more mods from Asia or oceania
2018-04-23 16:51:08 #kv-roundtable @Tony#9692: But which ping did I miss? I was at work dying, came online and vlicked on notification, then it disappeared
2018-04-23 16:51:23 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Oh not ping, pin
2018-04-23 16:51:29 #kv-roundtable @Tony#9692: Ooooh
2018-04-23 16:52:14 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Thanks in advance!
2018-04-23 16:52:26 #kv-roundtable @Tony#9692: Oh are you KV's owner?
2018-04-23 16:52:53 #kv-roundtable @Tony#9692: Well thanks for giving me the opportunity to meet the amazing people I've met in KV
2018-04-23 17:46:01 #kv-roundtable @Vivid#0001: Yes I am the owner, thank you.
2018-04-23 18:46:56 #kv-roundtable @NessaTheNerd#2947: Not a concern, just easy to say here
